    "# Greeting User\n",

    "```\n",
    "The user’s response will be saved to the variable, `name`.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def welcome(self):\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  self.handle_conversation(will_help)\n",
    "```\n",
    "To handle the indefinite length of a conversation, we use a `while` loop. The `while` loop can check if the user wants to continue the conversation after each response. Let’s say a user can only exit the conversation by responding with “stop.” Our `while` loop would look something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def handle_conversation(self, reply):\n",
    "  while not (reply == \"stop\"):\n",
    "    reply = input(\"How can I help you?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "At the moment, this code will respond “How can I help you?” to every user response but “stop” – not too useful. However, the `while` loop, as you’ll see over the next few exercises, provides a lot of flexibility for processing user input and responding with something that makes sense.\n",

    "- I need to go. I’ll come back later.\n",

    "To account for the variety of statements someone could make to exit a conversation, we created a method called `.make_exit()`. The purpose of this method is to check whether the user wants to leave the conversation. If they do, it returns `True`. If not, it returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.make_exit()` method accepts one argument, the user’s response. Within the method, we check whether the user’s response contains a word that is commonly used to exit a conversation. In script.py, we save a few of these words in a tuple called `exit_commands`.\n",

    " \n",
    "  return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the code above, we iterate over each word in `self.exit_commands`. If there is a match between the user’s input and a word from `self.exit_commands`, the method prints “Ok, have a nice day!” and returns `True`. If there is not a match, then the method returns `False`.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "while not make_exit(reply):\n",

    "# Entities\n",
    "To improve the functionality of a chatbot, we can also parse the user’s response and grab important information. For example, if you wanted to play a song from a virtual assistant, you could say, “Hey, play Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony.” In this example, Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony would be passed into an intent of the virtual assistant that plays music. We call the information that a chatbot passes from a user statement to a triggered intent an entity – also referred to as a slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chatbot we’ve built in this lesson, we need to collect the user’s account number when we call the `.pay_bill_intent()` method to credit their account. We can do this by adding a regular expression, like the one below, to the `pay_bill` list in `self.matching_phrases`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "regex = r'.*want.*pay.*my.*bill.*account.*number.*is (\\d+)'\n",
    "```\n",
    "If an utterance matches the above statement the `(\\d+)`, called a capture group, will grab the numeric value that follows the pattern. Notice, there is a space between “is” and `\"(\\d+)\"`, rather than a `.*` pattern. With the regular expression above, we can use the following to grab and print an account number:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "reply = \"i want to pay my bill. my account number is 888999333\"\n",
    "found_match = re.match(regex, reply)\n",
    "print(found_match.groups()[0]) # Prints: '888999333'\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code, the `found_match` variable contains the account number. We can grab this number using the `.groups()` method. Because there is only one group, we can use `found_match.groups()[0]` to grab the first, and only, group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the group, we can pass it into `.pay_bill_intent()`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def match_reply(self):\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  if found_match and (key == 'pay_bill'):\n",
    "    return self.pay_bill_intent(found_match.groups()[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code, we pass the account number, as an entity, into the `self.pay_bill_intent()` method if the `found_match` variable contains the account number. Otherwise, we call the method without passing the account number."

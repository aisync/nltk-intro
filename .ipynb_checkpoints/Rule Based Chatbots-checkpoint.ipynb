    "At this point, our chatbot has a mapping from regular expression patterns that represent user utterance to chatbot intents. In this exercise, we’ll use the regular expression library’s `.match()` method to check if a user’s utterance matches one of these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In script.py, we added a method called `.match_reply()` that we will use to match user utterances. Let’s walk step-by-step through the code for matching user utterances:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Iterate over each item in the dictionary\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def match_reply(self, reply):\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Check if user utterance matches a regular expression pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def match_reply(self, reply):\n",
    "  for key, values in self.matching_phrases.items():\n",

For example, if you wanted to play a song from a virtual assistant, you could say, “Hey, play Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony.” In this example, Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony would be passed into an intent of the virtual assistant that plays music. We call the information that a chatbot passes from a user statement to a triggered intent an entity – also referred to as a slot.\n",

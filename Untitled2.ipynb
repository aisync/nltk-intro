    "# What is Tf-idf?\n",
    "__Term frequency-inverse document frequency__ is a numerical statistic used to indicate how important a word is to each document in a collection of documents, or a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying tf-idf to a corpus, each word is given a tf-idf score for each document, representing the relevance of that word to the particular document. A higher tf-idf score indicates a term is more important to the corresponding document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tf-idf has many similarities with the bag-of-words language model, which if you recall is concerned with word count — how many times each word appears in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "While tf-idf can be used in any situation bag-of-words can be used, there is a key difference in how it is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tf-idf relies on two different metrics in order to come up with an overall score:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _term frequency_, or how often a word appears in a document. This is the same as bag-of-words’ word count.\n",
    "- _inverse document frequency_, which is a measure of how often a word appears in the overall corpus. By penalizing the score of words that appear throughout a corpus, tf-idf can give better insight into how important a word is to a particular document of a corpus."

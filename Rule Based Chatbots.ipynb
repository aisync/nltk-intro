    "At this point, we’ve built entry and exit paths to our rule-based chatbot. If someone were to interact with it, they would be greeted as if they were talking to a human, and they would be able to stop the conversation with a simple statement, like “goodbye.”\n",

    "At this point, our chatbot has a mapping from regular expression patterns that represent user utterance to chatbot intents. In this exercise, we’ll use the regular expression library’s `.match()` method to check if a user’s utterance matches one of these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In script.py, we added a method called `.match_reply()` that we will use to match user utterances. Let’s walk step-by-step through the code for matching user utterances:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Iterate over each item in the dictionary\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def match_reply(self, reply):\n",
    "  for key, values in self.matching_phrases.items():\n",
    "    for regex_pattern in values:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Check if user utterance matches a regular expression pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def match_reply(self, reply):\n",
    "  for key, values in self.matching_phrases.items():\n",
    "    for regex_pattern in values:\n",

    "      ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the code above, we use a conditional to check if found_match is `True`. In a future exercise, we will trigger an intent inside of this conditional. Here, we use an `input()` statement to ask another question and then return the `reply`.\n",

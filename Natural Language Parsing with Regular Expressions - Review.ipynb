    "- The `re` module’s `.compile()` and `.match()` methods allow you to enter any regex pattern and look for a single match at the beginning of a piece of text\n",
    "- The `re` module’s `.search()` method lets you find a single match to a regex pattern anywhere in a string, while the `.findall()` method finds all the matches of a regex pattern in a string\n",
    "- Part-of-speech tagging identifies and labels the part of speech of words in a sentence, and can be performed in `nltk` using the `pos_tag()` function\n",
    "- Chunking groups together patterns of words by their part-of-speech tag. Chunking can be performed in `nltk` by defining a piece of chunk grammar using regular expression syntax and calling a `RegexpParser`‘s `.parse()` method on a word tokenized sentence\n",
    "- NP-chunking chunks together an optional determiner `DT`, any number of adjectives `JJ`, and a noun `NN` to form a noun phrase. The frequency of different NP-chunks can identify important topics in a text or demonstrate how an author describes different subjects\n",
    "- VP-chunking chunks together a verb `VB`, a noun phrase, and an optional adverb `RB` to form a verb phrase. The frequency of different VP-chunks can give insight into what kind of action different subjects take or how the actions that different subjects take are described by an author, potentially indicating bias\n",
    "- Chunk filtering provides an alternative means of chunking by specifying what parts of speech you do not want in a chunk and removing them"

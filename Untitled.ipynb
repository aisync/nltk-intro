    "It is overly simplistic to point to an individual instruction set as lying within the purview of policy.  Our discussions have revolved around Dr. Waters and the guidance he has provided me.  I am not pointing to any specific procedural guidance overtly encumbering; instead, I am pointing to a nexus of misinformation that starts well before Dr. Waters and even Luis Ramirez.  \n",

    "If you have ultimately exhausted all efforts to follow the petition plan and are unsuccessful in matriculating back to the University and feel that the University has violated policy or has not afforded you equal opportunity to re-enroll, you may file a complaint with our office at that time.  We will then review and consult with the appropriate University office who has purview over these type of concerns.\n",

    "You can automate the part-of-speech tagging process with `nltk`‘s `pos_tag()` function! The function takes one argument, a list of words in the order they appear in a sentence, and returns a list of tuples, where the first entry in the tuple is a word and the second is the part-of-speech tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the sentence split into a list of words below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "word_sentence = ['do', 'you', 'suppose', 'oz', 'could', 'give', 'me', 'a', 'heart', '?']\n",
    "```\n",
    "you can tag the parts of speech as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "part_of_speech_tagged_sentence = pos_tag(word_sentence)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The call to `pos_tag()` will return the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[('do', 'VB'), ('you', 'PRP'), ('suppose', 'VB'), ('oz', 'NNS'), ('could', 'MD'), ('give', 'VB'), ('me', 'PRP'), ('a', 'DT'), ('heart', 'NN'), ('?', '.')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Abbreviations are given instead of the full part of speech name. Some common abbreviations include: `NN` for nouns, `VB` for verbs, `RB` for adverbs, `JJ` for adjectives, and `DT` for determiners. A [complete list of part-of-speech tags and their abbreviations can be found here.](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html)"

# Check out how much youâ€™ve learned about natural language processing!
#
# - Natural language processing combines computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence to enable computers to process human languages.
#
# - NLTK is a Python library used for NLP.
# - Text preprocessing is a stage of NLP focused on cleaning and preparing text for other NLP tasks.
# - Parsing is a stage of NLP concerned with breaking up text based on syntax.
# - Language models are probabilistic machine models of language use for NLP comprehension tasks. Common models include bag-of-words, n-gram models, and neural language modeling.
# - Topic modeling is the NLP process by which hidden topics are identified given a body of text.
# - Text similarity is a facet of NLP concerned with semblance between instances of language.
# - Language prediction is an application of NLP concerned with predicting language given preceding language.
# - There are many social and ethical considerations to take into account when designing NLP tools.

    "## BoW Dictionaries\n",

    "The words from the sentence go into the bag-of-words and come out as a dictionary of words with their corresponding counts. For statistical models, we call the text that we use to build the model our training data. Usually, we need to prepare our text data by breaking it up into documents (shorter strings of text, generally sentences).\n",
